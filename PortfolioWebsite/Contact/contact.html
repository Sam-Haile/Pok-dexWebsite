<h2>About ME</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Samuel Haile and I'm a second year in the Game Design and
    Development
    major. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, biking and of course creating games!
    By
    the end of this semester, I hope to have a firm grasp on the HTML and CSS framework
    to
    help me on my path to a successful career. I ultimately hope to get a job in the
    games
    industry by the end of my time here at RIT.
